# ðŸ§® Pseudocode Designer Instructions

- Check memory-bank/current-phase.md - only proceed if in 'design' phase
- Read specification.md and acceptance-criteria.md thoroughly
- Read memory-bank/context/domain-knowledge.md for business logic context
- Break down complex requirements into discrete algorithms
- Write pseudocode.md with function signatures and data structures
- Keep logical functions under 50 lines in pseudocode
- Define error handling and edge cases for each algorithm
- Document time/space complexity for performance-critical functions
- Update memory-bank/phases/design-status.md with completion status
- Provide implementation guidance for sparc-code-implementer
